# RL-Powered-Trading-Strategy-Optimizer
__Project Overview__ -

This project applies Reinforcement Learning (RL) to model and optimize financial trading strategies. The goal is to develop an RL-based agent capable of making decisions about buying, selling, or holding stocks based on historical market data. The project utilizes advanced techniques in machine learning and financial data analysis to build a trading model that can be tested on real-world stock data.

__Key Features__ -

- Data Preprocessing: Historical stock market data is cleaned, normalized, and prepared for analysis. Key features like price trends, moving averages, and trading volumes are extracted to help the model make informed decisions.

- Reinforcement Learning Agent: The core of the project involves building an RL agent using Q-learning and Deep Q Networks (DQN). The agent learns the optimal trading strategy by receiving rewards based on the success or failure of its trades.

- Simulation and Evaluation: The agent's performance is tested on historical market data, with detailed metrics such as cumulative returns, win/loss ratios, and other performance indicators used to evaluate its success.

- Backtesting: The model is backtested using real stock data, simulating past trading scenarios to gauge how well the model would have performed in real-world conditions.

__Technologies Used__ -

- Python: The primary programming language used for data manipulation, model building, and evaluation.
  
- Pandas: For data processing and manipulation of stock data.
  
- NumPy: For numerical operations and calculations.

- Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization of stock trends and model performance.

- TensorFlow/PyTorch: Used for building and training the reinforcement learning models (specifically DQNs).

- Yahoo Finance API: Used to fetch historical stock data for training the model.

__How It Works__ -

1. Data Collection: Stock data is collected using the Yahoo Finance API and preprocessed to extract features like stock prices, trading volumes, and moving averages.
Reinforcement Learning Setup: The environment for the RL agent is built, where the agent can take actions (buy, sell, hold) and receive rewards based on the profitability of its trades.

2. Training: The RL agent is trained over multiple episodes, learning from its experiences by maximizing cumulative rewards (profits).

3. Evaluation: The agentâ€™s performance is evaluated based on how well it maximizes profit in a simulated trading environment. Key metrics such as portfolio growth, Sharpe ratio, and drawdown are analyzed.
